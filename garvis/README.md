[GARVIS] stands for _Generative Assistant for Reliable Variables and INI Setup_. This application automatically generates configuration files (.ini) for training segmentation/classification models by combining:
- Interpretation of the user‚Äôs natural language prompt (e.g., ‚ÄúI want 20 epochs and metrics: Jaccard & Recall‚Äù)
- Automatic generation of a coherent configuration file based on best practices (batch size, early stopping, etc.)

## :gear: Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine: git clone `git@github.com:FloFive/SCHISM.git` 
2. Navigate to the cloned directory via a terminal prompt: `cd <some path> SCHISM/garvis`
3. Install the Streamlit library: `pip install streamlit`

## üß∞ Prerequisites
1. Python 3.12.10
2. [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) (UI)
3. OpenAI API Key

## :question: How to use

GARVIS offer a web interface to generate an INI file.

### General steps
1. Recover an OpenAI key to run the program. :warning: Be careful, as we are using a custom URL: Don't forget to adapt the code to your purpose to run the app. To adjust the API's URL, please check the `openai_as_requests` function from the `processing.py` file, and assign the right URL to the `url` variable.
2. Open a terminal prompt and navigate to the `SCHISM/garvis` folder, and run `garvis.py`.
3. Answer all the questions in lay terms and plain English (and don't forget [your OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)).
4. Hit the "Generate INI" button.
5. Double-check the generated `.ini` file on the right-hand panel.

## :brain: Knowledge base

Navigate to `cd <some path> SCHISM/garvis/knowledge_base` to access this part.

The knowledge base provides users with a centralized reference of configurations related to the image processing workflow and deep learning training. A broad set of examples is included, covering many possible scenarios and helping users get started faster with their own use cases.

On the first line of GARVIS, there is a line asking you to enter the path of `Project repository`. You have to enter here the path were there is your knowledge base.

There is also a tool allowing you to generate other random ini files. You can launch the program from terminal with `python generation_multiple.py`. You'll have to choose a path to save new files, then you'll have to choose how much random files you want to create. All files will be generated in a single folder inside choosen path, all named `hyperparameters.ini`. This feature isn't stable for now, feel free to improve this part.
Then, you can use this generated hyperparameter files to improve the knowledge base. If you want to add new files to knowledge base, you'll have to generate `augmented_hyperparameters.ini`, which is the same file as before + a new category name `Results`. There is in this part the best metrics values + the best loss value.
To use this part properly, please go inside `constants.py` and put the variable `AUGMENTED_HYPERPARAMETERS = True` to use this functionnality. At the end of a training session, at the same time the hyperparameter file is generated inside your saving folder, you'll also find an augmented_hyperparameter file, to be added to knowledge_base.
