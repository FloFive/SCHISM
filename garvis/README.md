[GARVIS] stands for _Generative Assistant for Reliable Variables and INI Setup_. This application automatically generates configuration files (.ini) for training segmentation/classification models by combining:
- Interpretation of the user‚Äôs natural language prompt (e.g., ‚ÄúI want 20 epochs and metrics: Jaccard & Recall‚Äù)
- Automatic generation of a coherent configuration file based on best practices (batch size, early stopping, etc.)

## :gear: Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine: git clone `git@github.com:FloFive/SCHISM.git` 
2. Navigate to the cloned directory via a terminal prompt: `cd <some path> SCHISM/garvis`
3. Install the Streamlit library: `pip install streamlit`

## üß∞ Prerequisites
1. Python 3.12.10
2. [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) (UI)
3. OpenAI API Key

## :question: How to use

GARVIS offer a web interface to generate an INI file.

### General steps
1. Recover an OpenAI key to run the program. :warning: Be careful, as we are using a custom URL: Don't forget to adapt the code to your purpose to run the app. To adjust the API's URL, please check the `openai_as_requests` function from the `processing.py` file, and assign the right URL to the `url` variable.
2. Open a terminal prompt and navigate to the `SCHISM/garvis` folder, and run `garvis.py`.
3. Answer all the questions in lay terms and plain English (and don't forget [your OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)).
4. Hit the "Generate INI" button.
5. Double-check the generated `.ini` file on the right-hand panel.

## :brain: Knowledge base

Navigate to `cd <some path> SCHISM/garvis/knowledge_base` to access this part.

The knowledge base provides users with a centralized reference for configurations related to the image processing workflow and deep learning training. It includes a wide range of examples covering many possible scenarios, helping users get started more quickly with their own use cases.

At the top of the GARVIS interface, there is a field asking you to enter the path to the Project repository. Here, you should specify the path where your knowledge base is located.

A separate tool is also available for generating random .ini files. You can run this program from the terminal using python `generation_multiple.py`. You will be asked to choose a path where the new files will be saved, and then to specify how many random files you want to create. All files will be generated in a single folder within the chosen path, each named `hyperparameters.ini`.

‚ö†Ô∏è Since this feature uses a language model to generate files, the results might not always be precise ‚Äî please review the generated hyperparmeter file before use.

You can then use the generated hyperparameter files to expand the knowledge base. To add new files to the knowledge base, you need to generate an `augmented_hyperparameters.ini` file, which is identical to the previous one but includes an additional category named Results. This section contains the best metric values and the lowest loss achieved during training.

To enable this functionality, open `constants.py` and set the variable `AUGMENTED_HYPERPARAMETERS = True`. When this is enabled, at the end of each training session, the program will automatically create both the regular `hyperparameters.ini` file (inside your saving folder) and an `augmented_hyperparameters.ini` file, which can then be added to the knowledge base.
