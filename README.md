SCHISM stands for _Semantic Classification of High-resolution Imaging for Scanned Materials_. This framework provides tools for the semantic segmentation of CT scanner images of rocks, but it is also applicable to any kind of image as long as semantic segmentation is required. The framework supports both training and inference workflows. As for the little trivia, this project got named after [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM62wjLrgmA&ab_channel=TOOLVEVO) :)

## :gear: Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ``` git clone git@github.com:FloFive/SCHISM.git ```

3. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ``` cd <some path> SCHISM ```
3. Install the library (Python 3.9 mini is required)
   ``` pip install -e .```

## :question: How to use

SCHISM offers three main functionalities: **Preprocessing**,  **Training** and **Inference**.

### General steps
1. Organise your data in the required structure (see Data Preparation).
2. Set up an INI configuration file (see INI File Setup).
3. Run the main script:
   ``` python schism.py ```
4. Navigate through the command-line menu:
    - Option 1: Preprocessing: Customise your data by computing dataset-specific mean and standard deviation for improved normalisation during training and/or reformat your segmentation masks to match the input format required by SCHISM.
    - Option 2: Training: train a new model.
    - Option 3: Inference: make predictions using a trained model.

---
### Preprocessing workflow
Two available options :
   - JSON generation: Compute the mean and standard deviation from part or all of your dataset. The results will be saved as a JSON file in your dataset folder.
   - Normalisation: Process your data to produce SCHISM-compatible segmentation masks. The original `masks` folder will be renamed to `raw_masks`, and the new, normalised masks will be saved in a newly created `masks` folder.

:warning: Input data must follow the format described in the [Data Preparation](https://github.com/FloFive/SCHISM/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#-data-preparation) section of the documentation.
    
---
### Training workflow
1. Prepare the dataset: Ensure the dataset is organised according to the required directory structure (presented below).
2. Create an INI file: Define training parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and model architecture in the INI file (presented below).
3. Run the training command: Launch the training process, then select the training option and specify:
    - The dataset directory: contains one or more datasets. The ordering and sorting of the data are explained later in this readme.
    - The output folder: the space where, amongst others, a folder containing the model weights will be created after training. The files saved in the folder are later described in this readme.
    - The path to the INI file.

---
### Inference workflow
To make predictions:
1. Use trained weights: Ensure the trained model weights are saved from the training phase.
2. Prepare the dataset for prediction: Organise the data in a compatible format.
3. Run the inference command: Launch the prediction process, then select the training option and specify:
    - The folder containing trained weights.
    - The dataset for prediction.

Predictions on the user's data will be saved in a directory named after the metric used during inference (e.g., `preds_X`, where `X` is the name of the selected evaluation metric).

## :scroll: INI File Setup

Below is an example of an INI file:

```
[Model]
n_block=4
channels=8
num_classes=3
model_type=UnetSegmentor
k_size=3
activation=leakyrelu
 
[Optimizer]
optimizer=Adam
lr=0.01

[Scheduler]
scheduler = ConstantLR

[Loss]
loss= CrossEntropyLoss
ignore_background=True
weights=True

[Training]
batch_size=4
val_split=0.8
epochs=50
metrics=Jaccard, ConfusionMatrix
 
[Data]
crop_size=128
img_res=560
num_samples=7000
```

For information on both the network configurations and the INI file setup, please refer to [this page](https://github.com/FloFive/SCHISM/blob/main/docs/ini.md).

## ðŸ‘¾ Data preparation

The data should be organised as follows:

``` 
data/  <--- Select this folder for normalisation, training, or inference
â”œâ”€â”€ dataset_1/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/       # Grayscale TIFF images (e.g., image0000.tif, image0001.tif, ...)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ masks/        # Corresponding TIFF masks (e.g., mask0000.tif for image0000.tif)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ raw_masks/    # Optional: original, unnormalized masks (renamed during normalisation)
â”œâ”€â”€ dataset_2/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ masks/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ raw_masks/
â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ dataset_n/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ masks/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ raw_masks/
â””â”€â”€ data_stats.json   # Optional, generated during JSON creation
```

### Directory descriptions

   - images/: Contains the grayscale TIFF input images, sequentially named for logical ordering.
   - masks/: Contains segmentation masks in SCHISM-compatible format (after normalisation, or provided by the user).
   - raw_masks/: Backup of original masks before normalisation.
   - data_stats.json: (Optional) Automatically generated during JSON creation. Stores mean and standard deviation values per dataset.

## ðŸ’¾ Training Output Files

 Upon completing a training session, several files will be generated in the weight folder:

- **data_stats.json**: The standard deviation and mean values used to normalize the images.
- **hyperparameters.ini**: A copy of the INI file used for the training session.
- **learning_curves.png**: Displays the loss and metrics values as a function of the epochs.
- **model_best_{metric(s)}.pth**: Contains the best model weights based on each metric specified in the INI file.
- **model_best_loss.pth**: Contains the best model weights based on the loss value.
- **test/train/val_indices.txt**: Records the indices of images and masks used for training, validation, and testing. These indices are formatted as `[dataset subfolder][image or mask number in the folder]`. For example, if you have 5,000 image/mask pairs, but `num_samples` is set to 3,000 and `val_split` is 0.8, then 2,400 indices will be recorded in `train_indices.txt`, 600 in `val_indices.txt`, and the remaining 2,000 in `test_indices.txt`.
